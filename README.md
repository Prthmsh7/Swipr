# Swipr - Flutter Travel Booking App

Swipr is a Tinder-inspired travel booking Flutter application for Android. The app allows users to browse through travel destinations and accommodations by swiping left (to reject) or right (to save/like) destinations.

## Features

- **Search by Budget and Days**: Users can input their budget and number of travel days to find suitable destinations.
- **Tinder-like Swiping Interface**: Swipe right to like a destination, left to reject it.
- **Saved Destinations**: View and manage all your liked destinations.
- **Modern UI**: Built with Flutter for a sleek, responsive interface.
- **Sample Data**: Currently uses sample data to demonstrate functionality (can be connected to a real API in the future).

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with a real travel API for live data, initially running the application from the live data.
- User authentication
- Booking functionality
- Additional filtering and sorting options
- AI-powered recommendations based on swipe history

Removed the entire code and made the entire repo clean to start a new project.
